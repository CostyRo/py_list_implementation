# py_list_implementation

I was challenged to implement my version of a list in python.  
I was not allowed to use any type of data structure(so without arrays, stacks, queues, dictionaries etc).  
I had to implement print, reverse, map and foreach.  
I came to implement also length, append, clear, copy, insert, pop and remove.  
At first it was a challenge, but turned into a mini alternative to lists.  
A lot of things can still be implemented, make lists subscriptables, overload the operators and other methods.  
It was a fun challenge, i was forced to do and to learn some new things to implement this.  
Maybe someday i will come with new features for this...
